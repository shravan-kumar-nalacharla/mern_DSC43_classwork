        <p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER, PLAY STORE</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Added support for indexing fresh, personalized YouTube developer videos on the Play Store, which
                increased user engagement by over 30% on certain surfaces, driving app installs and increasing revenue.
            </li>
            <li>Worked on projects incorporating LLM-generated content, specifically from Bard and Gemini, in new
                content experiences on the Play Store.</li>
            <li> Designed and implemented the Short Form Video Cluster backend, which surfaces YouTube Shorts on the
                Play Store</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NASA Langley Research Center </h3><br>
        <p>ASSEMBLERS SOFTWARE INTERNSHIP</p>
        <li> Created a Software in the Loop Simulation of the Assemblers robot, incorporating a physics engine and a
            real-time messaging service (DDS). Developed simulations of all hardware components, including joint
            controllers, the IMU, and cameras, all fully interoperable with real hardware.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a user interface for visualizing and recording the simulation. Used 3D models of
            the modular Stewart platforms to accurately display the robot interacting with elements on the lunar
            surface. This desktop application was built with Qt, Python, and C++. Integrated with the trajectory
            generator and executor to show log messages in the UI.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>U.S. Census Bureau</h3><br>
        <p>CIVIC DIGITAL FELLOWSHIP, SOFTWARE ENGINEER</p>
        <li> Engineered an NLP system for extracting and parsing pseudocode from 500+ page text documents, converting to
            an abstract object-oriented hierarchy. Processed this datastructure to generate executable Python code, used
            to validate decennial census data.
        </li>
        <li>Developed a REST service in Python to proxy requests to the Spark and Spark History UI, enabling access
            without ssh forwarding. Used bs4
            to parse HTML and rewrite URL paths. dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Nokia Bell Labs</h3><br>
        <p>ROBOTICS DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP</p>
        <li> Upgraded swerve drive robot platform to navigate autonomously, using ROS to handle data processing.
            Required substantial changes in hard- ware and software, with new motorcontrollers, motors, microprocessors,
            and kinematics software.
        </li>
        <li>Integrated onboard drivetrain control software developed in C++ and Python, utilizing odometry data from
            onboard encoders, LIDAR, computer vision and an IMU. New modular design enables hot-swapping sensors and end
            effectors.</li>

        <h3>RENTAL APPLICATION AUTOMATION TOOL</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cofounder of FlexApp, a tool that makes it easy for prospective renters to apply for apartments, and
                property
                managers to review applications.</li>
            <li>Lead developer of five-person team, created novel AI tools that read PDFs and converted the text to and
                from consistent formats, solving a major pain-point for both applicants and realtors.</li>
            <li>CreatedaReact&Next.jsbasedwebappdeployedtoAWSformanagingapplicationsandmakingthesubmittionprocessasseamlessaspossible,
                with one-click applications..</li>
            <li>Built AI models for matching applicants with the best rentals for their credit history and financial
                constraints. Created tools for interfacing with Plaid and banking data, to support renters who are
                under-banked.</li>
